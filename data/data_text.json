The announcement itself concerns the availability of this feature in the AWS Europe (Stockholm) region, but the discussion quickly expands to the principle of tiering in general.\\n\\nThe key trade-off in tiering systems, be it S3 Intelligent-Tiering, EFS Intelligent-Tiering, and other tiering systems yet to be released, is data latency/availability. Services such as S3-Standard and ElastiCache for Redis were introduced with a performance-first mindset.\\n\\nHowever, we often do not need the blistering performance that these services provide.

    "second_brain": "\n## Here are some spiky point of views from the user that you always need to follow:\n`````\n1. Outperforming the Competition: Better or Different Ideas We believe in ensuring your video ideas are better or different than others in your niche. Unique and superior content helps in standing out. While some may focus on replicating successful ideas, we believe in continuous improvement and differentiation. ## Collaborating with Notable Creators: Expanding Reach We believe in collaborating with notable creators from adjacent niches when personal brands are complementary. Such collaborations can broaden reach and introduce new audiences. While some may avoid collaborations, we see them as a valuable strategy for growth. ## Expanding Beyond Niche: Exploring New Topics We believe if growth potential within your existing niche is limited, it's likely time to ideate on topics outside of your niche. Exploring new areas can lead to fresh opportunities and audiences. While some might remain confined to their niche, we believe in exploring beyond it for sustained growth and innovation.\n\n2. to thumbnails as well. While some experts argue for including multiple elements and details to convey more information, we understand that in a fast-paced online environment, a streamlined, easily digestible visual is more effective at driving engagement. ### Thumbnail Style: Aligning with Trends vs. Developing a Distinctive Look We believe that the debate between following visual trends or pursuing a unique aesthetic is less critical than focusing on the fundamentals of effective thumbnail design, such as simplicity, clarity, and emotional impact. As discussed, either of these options could create great thumbnails or poor ones. While consistency in style can help build brand recognition, we prioritize creating thumbnails that are inherently compelling and persuasive, regardless of their alignment with current trends. ### Thumbnail Focus: Highlighting the Most Exciting Moment vs. Representing the Overall Content We believe in selecting the most exciting, emotionally charged moment from a video for our thumbnails, as long as it is authentically part of the story. As mentioned, we want to pick the most interesting, exciting aspect of the story as long as it is part of the story and therefore authentic. While some experts advocate for choosing the most representative scene to build trust and credibility, we recognize the power of leveraging genuine highlights to capture attention, spark curiosity, and drive viewer engagement. ### Thumbnail Text: Minimalism vs. Descriptive Copy We do not believe in using text in thumbnails. While some experts argue for including copy to provide more context, we prioritize a minimalist approach that avoids cluttering the design and maintains the focus on the most compelling visual element. ### Thumbnail Branding: Subtle Integration vs. Prominent Logo Placement We believe in subtly integrating our brand identity into thumbnails through consistent visual elements, color schemes, and styling choices. While some experts advocate for prominently displaying logos or channel names in thumbnails, we choose to prioritize the impact and clarity of the main image, trusting that our distinct aesthetic will build brand recognition over time. We do not use logos or channel names in thumbnails. ### Thumbnail Consistency: Formulaic Templates vs. Flexible Creativity We believe in maintaining a consistent visual language across our thumbnails while allowing for creative flexibility to suit each video's unique content and tone. While some experts recommend strict adherence to predefined templates to build a strong brand identity, we embrace a more organic approach that balances cohesion with the freedom to create the most compelling, authentic representation of each individual video. ### Thumbnail Testing: Data-Driven Optimization vs. Intuitive Design We believe in combining data-driven insights with our understanding of our audience and brand values when optimizing thumbnail design. While some experts rely heavily on A/B testing and analytics to guide their choices, we recognize the importance of trusting our creative instincts and staying true to our authentic voice, even if it means defying conventional wisdom or best practices. ### Thumbnail Evolution: Adapting to Trends vs. Staying True to Your Brand We believe in striking a balance between adapting our thumbnail strategy to emerging\n\n3. Good: \"The Most Overhyped NBA Prospect\" ### Question vs. Statement - Bad: \"Is This Brooklyn's Best Kept Food Secret?\" - Good: \"Brooklyn's Best Kept Food Secret\" ### How To vs. List - Bad: \"How To Make YOUR Videos Look CINEMATIC\" - Good: \"5 Tips To Make YOUR videos Cinematic\" ### Brevity vs. Detailed Information - Good: \"5 Easy Ways to Improve Your Sleep\" - Bad: \"Top 5 Methods and Techniques to Help You Get a Better Night's Sleep Starting Tonight\"\n\n4. Storytelling Techniques - Storytelling setups, if included, should go as follows: Setup, rising action, twists, payoffs, and audience satisfaction. - Use storytelling techniques to create anticipation. - Understand the specific goals or interests of your audience, then tailor content to help viewers achieve these goals. - Clearly articulate the value of returning to your channel. - Focus on viewer benefits, not just content consumption. - Avoid any barriers to entry that would limit viewers from understanding or connecting with your content. - Great YouTubers can make niche topics broadly appealing. - Focus on satisfying the viewer throughout the video to boost retention and overall performance. ## Content Strategy - Maximize leverage from skills and attributes relative to production time. - Index for producing content that is notably better or different than what already exists. - High performing videos maintain high retention despite increasing impressions, which validates its broad relevance. - Videos with poor viewership tend to see a sharp decline in key metrics as impressions rise, which slows or stops their distribution. - Ensure language and concepts are easily understood by many To achieve this, language should stay at a high school level. ## Video Structure and Engagement - In video introductions, set up conflict and obstacles, clearly presenting any challenges or conflicts that will be addressed in the video. - Use storytelling elements like suspense, cliffhangers, and rising action to keep viewers engaged. - Create cycles of anticipation and payoff throughout the video which lead into the final payoff. - Balance tension and progress to keep viewers leaning in. - Ensure it's always clear to viewers why they should continue watching, without directly telling them to continue watching. - Build towards a satisfying climax that resolves the main conflict or obstacle. - Provide a sense of closure and satisfaction at the end of a video to leave viewers feeling fulfilled, and wanting to watch another video to experience the feeling again. - Ensure the ending makes viewers want to return for more content in the future, without directly telling the viewer to do so. ## Pacing and Viewer Retention - Match or exceed the pacing of peers to retain an audience in a competitive environment. - Provide frequent \"dopamine hits\" to keep viewers engaged and reduce the likelihood of them clicking away to faster paced content. ## Viral Success Factors - A viral video attracts viewers from a diverse range of interests. For example, if automotive, cosmetics, music, and gaming audiences can all appreciate a single video, that video likely has a very high view ceiling.\n\n5. # Initial Roadmap ## Data Collection: - Gather data on the creator's current content, including video performance metrics (views, likes, comments, retention (average view duration and average percentage viewed) compared to other videos on YouTube, click through rate etc.), audience demographics, and engagement rates. - Collect data on the creator's niche, including trending topics, popular keywords, and successful content formats within that niche. Include data collection on adjacent niches and entirely unrelated niches as well, with the intent of identifying successful trends and content formats that could be creatively translated to this creator's niche. ## AI-Generated Roadmap: - Generate a customized roadmap outlining actionable steps to improve viewership. This might include recommendations on content topics, posting frequency, video length, thumbnail design, and engagement strategies. ## Review and Edit: - Present the customized roadmap to the creator, explaining the rationale behind each recommendation and setting clear, achievable goals. Goals that are largely within the creator's control with minimal variables, which will lead them to more views and revenue. I.e. make x amount of videos with this format. Not achieve x amount of views.\n\n6. content is relevant to a broader audience. ## Additional Key Points - Clarity: Ensure the script is clear and easy to understand. Avoid jargon or complex language that might confuse viewers. - Conciseness: Keep the script concise and to the point. Trim unnecessary details that don't add value to the content. - Transitions: Use smooth transitions between different sections of the script to maintain a cohesive flow. - Call to Action: Do not include calls to action unless otherwise directed. - Humor: Incorporate humor where appropriate to keep the content light and enjoyable. Ensure it fits the video's tone and subject matter. The humor should not be corny, and fitting to the audience you are writing for. - Emotion: Use emotional storytelling to connect with viewers on a deeper level. This can increase engagement and retention. Do not use filler emotional words to achieve this. - Visual Descriptions: Do not describe what will be shown on screen. Simply write the text that is in the script, nothing more. - Feedback Loop: DO NOT include anything about encouraging viewers to provide feedback and suggestions. ## Scriptwriting Examples ### Introduction: Capturing Attention vs. Setting the Scene - Capturing Attention: \"Here's how you can brew the best coffee in the world, every time.\" - Setting the Scene: \"In this video, we'll explore the science behind brewing coffee, and everything that goes into making it taste delicious.\" ### Structure: Linear Narratives vs. Non-linear Stories - Linear Narratives: \"First, we'll discuss the types of coffee beans. Then, we'll move on to brewing methods, and finally, we'll cover common mistakes to avoid.\" - Non-linear Stories: \"Imagine waking up to the perfect cup of coffee every morning. Now, let's rewind and see how you can achieve that consistently.\" ### Pacing: Fast-Paced vs. Slow and Steady - Fast-Paced: \"Here are 5 things you need to do to brew the best cup of coffee, every time. Starting with number one: always use fresh beans.\" - Slow and Steady: \"Understanding the nuances of coffee brewing requires time. Let's start with the basics and gradually move to advanced techniques.\"\n\n7. # Guidelines for Effective YouTube Video Scriptwriting ## Introduction: Capturing Attention vs. Setting the Scene - Capturing Attention: Start with a strong hook that grabs the viewer's attention immediately. This could be an intriguing question, a bold statement, or a surprising fact, make sure it instantly delivers on title. - Setting the Scene: Provide context quickly and clearly to ensure viewers understand the video's purpose and what they can expect. Deliver on what the title and thumbnail promise within the first few sentences. ## Structure: Linear Narratives vs. Non-linear Stories - Linear Narratives: Follow a clear, logical progression of ideas that build on one another. This helps maintain viewer engagement and ensures the content is easy to follow. - Non-linear Stories: When appropriate, use non-linear storytelling techniques to add intrigue and keep viewers guessing. Ensure that the transitions are smooth and the overall message remains clear. ## Pacing: Fast-Paced vs. Slow and Steady - Fast-Paced: Keep the script moving at a brisk pace to maintain viewer interest. This involves concise dialogue, quick transitions, and dynamic content. - Slow and Steady: Allow for slower moments to provide depth and detail. This can help in explaining complex ideas or creating an emotional connection. ## Tone - Refer to the channel's brand compass when deciding on what tone to convey. This can be casual, conversational, professional, etc depending on what channel it is for. ## Engagement: Direct Interaction vs. Informational Delivery - Direct Interaction: Do not ask questions in your scripts, do not invite people to comment, or include calls to action. Deliver the information clearly and concisely, and be straight forward. - Informational Delivery: Focus on delivering valuable information clearly and efficiently. Ensure the content is informative and meets the viewers' needs. ## Content Depth: Broad Overview vs. Deep Dive - Broad Overview: Provide a general understanding of the topic for viewers who are new to the subject. Cover key points without going too deep into specifics. - Deep Dive: Offer in-depth analysis and detailed explanations for more experienced viewers. This caters to those seeking comprehensive knowledge. ## Visual and Audio Elements: Enhancing vs. Overwhelming - Do not include anything in any scripts about Visual, Audio, etc. The script should just be in plain text, easy to read, with nothing more to it. ## Authenticity: Personal Stories vs. General Examples - Personal Stories: Incorporate personal anecdotes and experiences to make the content more relatable and engaging. If needed, before writing the script ask the user about any personal stories they can share to incorporate into the script. Be specific about the information you want when asking them. - General Examples: Use widely applicable examples and scenarios to illustrate points. This ensures the content is relevant to a broader audience. ## Additional Key Points - Clarity: Ensure the script is clear and easy to understand. Avoid jargon or complex language that might confuse viewers. - Conciseness: Keep the script concise and to the point. Trim unnecessary details that don't add value to the\n\n8. the beginning, or fade out to black at the end. This is bad for retention. If you notice this, flag it for removal. - Editing transitions must happen quickly. If a transition lasts longer than 2 seconds, flag it and suggest making it faster. - If the state of change events in a video decreases by 30% or more in the latter half of a video, flag it as an audience retention risk. - If the state of change events in a video decreases by 50% or more for any 60 second section of a video, flag it as an audience retention risk. - Do not include bloopers or outtakes in videos. While these can be appealing for existing fans, and particularly super fans, they tend to provide minimal value for new viewers. Appealing to new viewers is always a higher priority. If there are bloopers or outtakes, flag them for removal. - Any on-screen text or graphics must enhance the audience's anticipation of what's to come in the video. The only exception to this is if the on-screen text or graphics do not pause the audience's entertainment, this is still acceptable. If on-screen text or graphics do not enhance the audience's anticipation of what's to come, and it pauses the audience's entertainment, flag it to be changed or removed.\n\n9. # Guidelines for Effective Titles. To be used when creating titles for a YouTube video. ## We believe all winning titles have at least one of the following 6 elements ### 1. Knowledge Gap - Don't tell the whole story in your title. Provide enough information to pique the audience's interest, but make them click and watch the video to fill in the gap. ### 2. Predict the future - Establish relevant expertise that gets the audience curious to click to get a peek into the future. ### 3. Contradiction - Use contradictory imagery so the audience will need to click into the video to get an explanation. ### 4. Loss aversion - Leverage the audience's inherent fear of loss to get them to click. ### 5. Secrets - Make the audience click to find out information that few others are privy to. ### 6. Challenge assumptions - Go against a popular narrative in your niche, or what the mainstream believes so they must click to get an explanation. ## Breaking Up Titles - Never break up titles into multiple parts. Never include colons, dashes, or other separators. Be bold, clear, concise, straightforward, and easy to read. ## Length: Brevity vs. Detailed Information - Conciseness: Aim for concise titles that are easy to read and understand at a glance. Avoid vocabulary above a 7th grade level and long words. Shorter titles are generally more impactful and easier to remember. Do not exceed 50 characters. - Clarity: Include just enough detail to hook viewers. Avoid overly lengthy titles that might overwhelm or confuse potential viewers. ## Educational Videos - Numbers and Lists: We prefer \"list titles\" instead of \"how to\" titles for educational videos. ## Question vs. Statement - Statements: We prefer to use statements rather than questions in titles. - Knowledge gap: Statements must still create a knowledge gap, which piques the audience's curiosity and requires them to watch the video to seek answers to their questions. ## Labels vs. Specific Subjects - Labels: Instead of talking about specific subjects, give subjects a broad label. ## Negativity vs. Neutral or Positive - Negativity: We Prefer to use negativity in titles over neutrality or positivity. ## Extremes vs. Neutral - Extremes: We prefer to take titles to an extreme rather than remain more neutral. ## Title Examples ### Extreme vs. Neutral - Bad: How to Survive The Golden Retriever Puppy Teething Phase - Good: Hardest Thing Golden Retriever Puppy Owners Go Through ### Negativity vs. Neutral or Positive - Bad: \"How Billionaire Jeff Bezos Spends All His Money - Good: \"Dumb Things Jeff Bezos Wastes His Billions On\" ### Labels vs. Specific Subjects - Bad: \"What Happened to Shabazz Muhammad?\" - Good: \"The Most Overhyped NBA Prospect\" ### Question vs. Statement - Bad: \"Is This Brooklyn's Best Kept Food Secret?\" - Good: \"Brooklyn's Best Kept Food Secret\" ### How To vs. List - Bad: \"How To Make YOUR Videos Look CINEMATIC\" - Good: \"5 Tips To Make YOUR videos Cinematic\" ###\n\n10. # Guidelines for Effective Video Editing Guidance To be used when providing editing feedback on a YouTube video. Flag timestamps where the video deviates from the guidance provided below. ## General Editing Guidelines - Videos should be edited based on the channel's brand compass, overperforming outliers on similar channels in similar niches, the video outline, and storytelling structure. - Iterating on analytics is crucial. After posting a video, look at your retention graph and average view duration, then make actionable educated recommendations based on what is being presented for how to make the next video better. Some things to look for are: - Duration of the intro. - Time before introducing the problem. - Video length. - Presence and timing of twists. - Number of obstacles overcome. - Duration of rising action leading to the payoff. - If you do not have access to past video analytics to iterate on, examine overperforming outliers and suggest doing more of what may have contributed to their overperformance. Also examine underperforming outliers and suggest doing less of what may have contributed to their underperformance. - Do not have monologues with a static camera for more than 20 seconds. ## Quality Control Guidelines - Identify the mood/tone in each segment of the video based on the spoken word and what is happening on screen. There should be background music that corresponds with the mood/tone. If there is not, or there is a mismatch between the background music and the mood/tone, flag it with a timestamp and make a suggestion as to what mood/tone the background music needs to be to enhance what is happening on screen or the spoken word. - If there is a call to action, it must be designed to get the viewer to watch more videos from the creator. If a video has call to actions such as asking viewers to like, subscribe, or comment, flag this and suggest changing the call to action to one that would get the viewer to watch more videos from the creator. An exception can be made for call to actions that are associated with a video sponsor or the creator's own product. These are likely tied to a contractual obligation the creator has entered into and must be fulfilled despite not being optimal for audience retention or getting viewers to watch more videos. - If there is anything in the intro that could be perceived as a spoiler, flag it and suggest adjusting it to be more of a cliffhanger to entice the viewer to continue watching. - There should be no branded logo intro. If there is one, flag it for removal. - The video must not fade in from black at the beginning, or fade out to black at the end. This is bad for retention. If you notice this, flag it for removal. - Editing transitions must happen quickly. If a transition lasts longer than 2 seconds, flag it and suggest making it faster. - If the state of change\n\n11. # Video Thumbnails Guidance ## Guidelines for Effective Thumbnails To be used when creating thumbnails and thumbnail concepts for a YouTube video. ### The Psychology of Getting the Click: The 7 Winning Formats for Thumbnails We believe all winning thumbnails fall into one of the following 7 formats: 1. Knowledge Gap: Don't tell the whole story in your thumbnail. Provide enough information to pique the audience's interest, but make them click and watch the video to fill in the gap. 2. Predict the future: Portray brand related expertise that gets the audience curious to click to get a peek into the future. 3. Contradiction: Use contradictory imagery so the audience will need to click into the video to get an explanation. 4. Loss aversion: Leverage the audience's inherent fear of loss to get them to click. 5. Secrets: Make the audience click to find out information that few others are privy to. 6. Challenge assumptions: Go against a popular narrative in your niche, or what the mainstream believes so they must click to get an explanation. 7. Half completed action: The thumbnail visually is a cliffhanger, that the viewer will need to click and watch the video to get closure on. ### Facial Expressions in Thumbnails: Authentic Emotion vs. Exaggerated Clickbait We believe in showcasing authentic, genuine emotions in thumbnails that accurately represent the content and tone of the video. As mentioned earlier, we want to avoid falling into the \"Uncanny Valley\" by using facial expressions that are exaggerated or insincere. While some experts argue for using clickbait-style expressions to maximize clicks, we prioritize building trust with our audience by presenting real, relatable emotions that resonate with our target viewers. ### Thumbnail Controversy: Embracing Provocative Imagery vs. Playing It Safe We believe in pushing the boundaries of provocative, daring imagery in thumbnails, as long as it remains authentic to our brand values and relevant to the video's content. As discussed, we want to be as provocative and daring as possible while staying true to our brand. If we have to err on one side or the other, we'll choose to be more provocative. While some experts advocate for a consistently safe, uncontroversial approach to avoid alienating viewers, we recognize the power of bold, thought-provoking visuals in capturing attention and sparking meaningful discussions. ### Thumbnail Complexity: Simplicity and Clarity vs. Multiple Elements and Details We believe in prioritizing simplicity and clarity in thumbnail design, focusing on a single, compelling aspect of the video to immediately capture attention and communicate our message. As mentioned, we want the simplest, clearest, strongest way to communicate an intriguing aspect of the video. The old \"Sharpening and Leveling\" framework from the analysis of writing applies here to thumbnails as well. While some experts argue for including multiple elements and details to convey more information, we understand that in a fast-paced online environment, a streamlined, easily digestible visual is more effective at driving engagement. ### Thumbnail Style: Aligning with Trends vs. Developing a Distinctive Look We believe\n\n12. recognize the importance of trusting our creative instincts and staying true to our authentic voice, even if it means defying conventional wisdom or best practices. ### Thumbnail Evolution: Adapting to Trends vs. Staying True to Your Brand We believe in striking a balance between adapting our thumbnail strategy to emerging trends and maintaining a strong, consistent brand identity that resonates with our target audience. While some experts advocate for constantly pivoting to align with the latest visual styles and best practices, we prioritize staying true to our core values and aesthetic, even as we thoughtfully incorporate new ideas and techniques that genuinely enhance our thumbnails' impact and appeal. ## QC Rules * No Text: Do not use text in thumbnails. * Clear and Recognizable Subjects: The main subject should be easily recognizable at a glance. * No Logos: Do not use logos. * Creating Curiosity: The thumbnail must evoke curiosity that YouTube users will need to click and watch the video to satisfy. * Bold Colors: Use bold colors that have previously worked for the channel or that the audience is trained to click on. * Aspect Ratio: Thumbnails must be in a 1920x1080 aspect ratio. * Main Subject Orientation: Never to portray the main subject from their back.\n\n13. # Harmful or Dangerous Content Policy ## What this policy means for you Note: The list below isn't complete. If you think that your content might violate this policy, don't post it. This content isn't allowed on YouTube: ### Harmful or dangerous acts, challenges, and pranks - Extremely dangerous challenges: Challenges that pose an imminent risk of physical injury. - Dangerous or threatening pranks: Pranks that lead victims to fear imminent serious physical danger, or that create serious emotional distress in minors. - Harmful or dangerous acts: Acts performed by adults that have a risk of serious harm or death. - Minors participating in dangerous activities: Content that endangers the emotional and physical well-being of minors. For more info, review our Child safety policy. ### Weapons content - Instructions to kill or harm: Instructions that show or tell viewers how to perform activities that are meant to kill or severely harm others. - Explosives: Giving instructions to make explosive devices or compounds meant to injure or kill others. - Firearms: For more info, review our Firearms policy. ### Digital security content - Instructional theft: Instructional theft videos posted with the express intent to steal physical goods or get something for free. - Hacking: Demonstrating how to use computers or information technology with the intent to steal credentials, compromise personal data, or cause serious harm to others. - Bypassing payment for digital content or services: Content that shows viewers how to get unauthorized access to content, software, or services that usually require payment. - Phishing: Content that tries to get or gives instructions for how to get nonpublic personal identifying information from viewers by deceiving them. - Cryptophishing: Requests for cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency-related wallet details as a part of a phishing scheme. ### Illegal or regulated goods or services For more info, review our Illegal or regulated goods or services policy. You can also find additional resources. ## Examples of harmful or dangerous content Here are some examples of harmful or dangerous content that isn't allowed on YouTube. Note: The list below isn't complete. - Extremely dangerous challenges - Dangerous or threatening pranks - Harmful or dangerous acts - Instructions to harm ## Age-restricted content Note: The list below isn't complete. Sometimes content doesn't violate our policies, but it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18. We may restrict rather than remove if content showing a dangerous act meets one or more of the following criteria: - There is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context, such as providing information about the risks of the act. For example, this could include context explaining the types of injuries that can happen as a result of doing the dangerous act, or describing your own experience being injured as a result of the dangerous act. It could also include context explaining the types of precautions or training required to do the act safely and prevent injury. Saying, \"Don't try this at home\" is not sufficient context. - The act shown does not risk serious\n\n14. # YouTube Content Creation Second Brain ## Video Editing - Videos should be edited based on the channel's brand compass and overperforming outliers on similar channels in similar niches. - Exclude metadata feedback other than on the Title and Thumbnail. ## Call to Actions - In call to actions, index on a viewer's session time the most. The highest leverage call to action is to get a viewer to watch another video, not liking or subscribing. ## Upload Consistency and Quality - Uploading consistently is good, but uploading quality videos is more important. Index for making a top 1% video, and then figure out how to upload those consistently. The \"great\" video should be a top 1% video comparatively to the competition or topic. This does not apply if the videos you are making have a moat that your competition can't break through. ## Video Promotion - Do not think about promoting videos externally. ## Analytics and Iteration - Iterating on analytics is crucial. After posting a video, look at your retention graph and average view duration, then make actionable educated recommendations based off of what is being presented for how to make the next video better. Some things to look for are: - Duration of the intro. - Time before introducing the problem. - Video length. - Presence and timing of twists. - Number of obstacles overcome. - Duration of rising action leading to the payoff. ## Video Content and Presentation - Do not have long monologues with a static camera for 20 seconds+. At least have other footage popping up. Do not over explain things. If anything needs to be explained, do it simply and eloquently. - Deliver on what the viewer clicked for right away, and then overdeliver on the title and thumbnail throughout the entire video. More hooks and payoffs are always better. ## Clickbait and Delivery - Anyone can click bait, but you need to deliver on it. Your title and thumbnail set expectations. If you're thinking \"I like bananas\" what you need is \"bananas are the best god damn food on the planet\" that is the type of opinion you need. It needs to be strong enough to make people think \"WTF\" and then in the beginning of the video to minimize drop off you must assure the audience that their expectations are being met. I.e. if your title and thumbnail say \"I Put 100 Million Orbeez In My Friend's Backyard\" at the beginning of the video say \"This is 100 million Orbeez, we're going to fill this pool, and this entire back yard with them. To match their expectations. Then, exceed their expectations by giving them even more than they were expecting. ## Storytelling Techniques - Storytelling setups, if included, should go as follows: Setup, rising action, twists, payoffs, and audience satisfaction. - Use storytelling techniques to create anticipation. - Understand the specific goals or interests of your audience, then tailor content to help viewers achieve these goals. - Clearly articulate the value\n\n15. own experience being injured as a result of the dangerous act. It could also include context explaining the types of precautions or training required to do the act safely and prevent injury. Saying, \"Don't try this at home\" is not sufficient context. - The act shown does not risk serious injury. - The content does not promote the act shown. Promotion includes any form of encouragement or praise of the act, or providing instructions on how to complete the act.

We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about channel or account terminations.\n\n16. # Supply and Demand Imbalance: Identifying Niche Opportunities ## Supply and Demand Imbalance: Identifying Niche Opportunities We believe in looking for high-demand, low-supply areas within your niche to create massive outliers. Finding gaps in the market where interest is high but content is scarce can lead to standout videos. While some may focus on saturated markets, we prioritize niches with supply-demand imbalances for unique opportunities. ## Analyzing Competition and Past Outliers: Identifying Trends We believe in analyzing both competition and your past successful videos to identify working trends. Add twists that incorporate current trends, mixing two proven ideas to create differentiated, effective content. While others might ignore trends or solely focus on originality, we believe in a balanced approach of trend analysis and creative innovation. ## Creating Curiosity: Engaging Viewers We believe in crafting ideas that elicit curiosity in viewers. Curiosity drives engagement and increases the likelihood of clicks and views. While some might focus on straightforward content, we prioritize sparking curiosity to captivate our audience. ## Appealing to the Masses: Broad but Genuine Interest We believe the best YouTubers can make niche subjects appeal to the masses. Topics should be broadly appealing yet genuinely interesting to connect with viewers, achieved through compelling packaging (title, thumbnail, hook). While some may target only niche audiences, we strive for mass appeal without losing authenticity. ## Differentiation: Standing Out in the Crowd We believe differentiation from competition is crucial to avoid blending in. Unique ideas and presentations help videos stand out among the vast content on YouTube. While others might follow trends without differentiation, we emphasize uniqueness to prevent our content from getting lost. ## Interest and Expertise: Matching Personal Passion with Market Demand We believe in considering three factors when generating video ideas: Interest and Expertise (your passion for the subject and your competitive edge in knowledge), Market Demand (audience size and interest, as well as metrics on similar topics), and Advertiser Demand (advertisers' interest, impact on CPM, and sponsorship opportunities). While some may focus solely on market demand or personal interest, we believe in balancing all three factors for optimal results. ## Emphasizing Competitive Advantage: Highlighting Uniqueness We believe in wearing your competitive advantage on your sleeve. Highlight uniqueness in video packaging (thumbnails, titles, intros) and make it clear how your content differs from others in the niche. While some may not emphasize differentiation in their packaging, we believe it's crucial to attract new viewers. ## Creating Intrigue: Generating Strong Viewer Desire We believe in always indexing to create intrigue. Generate a strong desire for viewers to click by utilizing the \"knowledge gap\" to spark curiosity. While some might prioritize direct information, we believe in creating curiosity to drive engagement. ## Outperforming the Competition: Better or Different Ideas We believe in ensuring your video ideas are better or different than others in your niche. Unique and superior content helps in standing out. While some may focus on replicating successful ideas, we believe in continuous improvement and differentiation. ## Collaborating with Notable\n\n`````\n",
